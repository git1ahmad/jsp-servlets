Instead of anntaion we can configure web.xml for a servlet like 
servlet name, class ,mapping , urlpattern
in comparison to servlet mapping and annotation servlet config is more 
so why we do that ?
1.Annotation support started from java version 5 before after still used xml config
2.change in annotation will change the code compile the class again and run it again  
changes in xmlconfig will cause to restart tomcat 
Annotation is prefeered bcz its less typy and easy
