Annotaion basics
localhost://8080/SimpleServletProject/SimpleServlet
whenever anyone acceses url pattern of the annotation not the java file name then execute 
the methods of the java class 
Inorder to write a servlet we hava to extend the servlet class to HHtpServlet
Annotation has two properties
1.description a simple description of the servlet
2.url pattern 
context root of the web application = web application name
url pattern is the key which tells the tomcat whenever an access to /SimpleServlet comes to the context root of the web application then execute this class 
 
Browser used by client through url 
Tomcat contains web appications 
url tells tomcat what to do 
tomcat creates two objects 
1. requests 
2. responses
request object contains details about the client request made it an have post or etc 
tomcat uses request object to identify the particular web application to run 
then it goes to the web.xml/ annottions  and finally identifies the servlet 

tomcat passes the requests and response objects to the servlet 
servlet takes the request process it and returns to the response object 

tomcat again takes the objects like response and sends to the browser and browser renders it to the client in html 
u can change or edit the url pattern name
