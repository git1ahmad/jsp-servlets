objects in a servlet 
1. request and response objects
2.Servlet itself is a object 
web application is deployed in tomcat container 
servlet runs inside a container of tomcat 
servlet object is also initialized by tomcat 
response object is for writing 
when the browser makes a request tomcat generates two objects and request and response is 
passed to the servlet and servlett uses do get method runs and pulls data from  request 
 writes data to response object and servlet completes request 

Everytime there is a new request from the same and different browser tomcat creates the new 
request and response object for every request of browser 
tomcat does not reuse the object 
Servlet objects are reused they are not created per request 
servlets have different threads for different users benificial for less resource not instances 

Http protocol are stateless protocol 
when we make a request servlet doesn't remember our protocol parameter

session Objects:
In order to save useranem and data in server you have to use session object 
session.setAttribute("savedUserName", userName);
(String) session.getAttribute("savedUserName")
session object returns an object so use datatype before expected data  

dogetmethod --> when pass you username you will see result both in request object and session object 

but if you don't pass any unsername in the url request object has null usrname but session object 
has still the last username in output 

same for a new username as input and output will be working like 

Application of session objects : Login Screens and shopping carts

Request input from a new browser will not contain the record of session objects
