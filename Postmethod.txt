let's say we want to change the output of prinln depending on USer
by parameter
parameter in the url comes through the request object to servlet
?userName= ahmad this parameter goes to httprequest object and then request.getParameter("userName") takes the name from url 
and prints it 
doPost Method 
for html and form 
when a form is submitted by default it will go to the doget method


for doGet method::
<form action="xmlServletpath">
 <input name = "userName" />
 <input type = "submit" />

</form>

for doPost method::
<form method = Post action="xmlServletpath">
 <input name = "userName" />
 <input type = "submit" />

</form>
